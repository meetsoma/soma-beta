  Slot order matters for cache efficiency — sticky content first,
  volatile content last. Run `soma body slots` to inspect live cost.

<!-- Cache economics: editing a slot invalidates everything BELOW it
     in the model's cached prompt. Put sticky content (identity,
     project context) early; put volatile content (inbox, timestamps,
     runtime state) last. Run `soma body slots` to see the byte-cost
     of each slot, and `soma body audit` for layout issues. -->

<!-- Behavioral protocols + muscle memory are already prepended by the
     compiler before this template renders. Don't interpolate
     {{protocol_summaries}} / {{muscle_digests}} / {{scripts_table}}
     here — that duplicates what's already in the prompt above. -->

<!-- Volatile slots last: they churn every session (inbox arrivals,
     cwd changes, context awareness). Placing them here minimizes
     cache-bust reach — only content below invalidates, which is nothing. -->
